## About The Project
This project was built with the intention of creating a webapp that serves the purpose of recording basketball scores, which include
player scores, and team scores on the court, while also providing a real-time analysis and calculation of team/ player statistics to help 
a local basketball team grow. 

The idea was that local basketball teams don't have the time and resources to hire an analytics team to help with analyzing player combinations
and player / team performancesm, leading to non data driven adjustments. This website will serve as a platform to integrate posts, player management, 
score-tracking, and analysis all in one place.
