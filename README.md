# PlayerCompass
PlayerCompass, a web app designed to help you navigate a player through visualization. This web app is built using a Flask backend and a React frontend with features including Player career statistics, shooting statistics and passing statistics. The data is pulled directly from nba.com using a python backend api that retreives the data for the specific player

## About The Project
I wanted to create a nice visualization tool in hopes for teams to understand how a player is progressing throughout his career, what changes he should make in terms of shooting, and gain a glimpse on what teammates the player interact with the most through passing.

### How to run the app

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone [my-repo]
   ```
2. Go to frontend directory
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Go to backend directory
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Enjoy!
